## Relevant instructions for what to do after completing an assignment/exercise

### 1. Watch the demonstration modules

- You'll eventually find demonstration modules for each of the assignments. You can use these to compare designs. 

### 2. Get feedback on your work

- **First, get the assignment hashtag**: Each assignment has a hashtag to identify it (ie: #palindromeChecker) uniquely. You can find this in the readme for each assignment and exercise. Grab this.
- **Create  PR**: Create a PR containing your commits for an assignment or exercise. 
- **Finally, submit for feedback**: Post to [#course-chat](https://discord.com/channels/997940575590416435/1074124524632674335) for feedback from myself, the alumni, and the other community members.

Here's an example:

> "I just finished #palindromeChecker here. Would love some feedback on my commits. Start (\<insert link to first commit>), end (\<insert link to end commit>). Cheers!

### 3. Review a submission

- **Get to the Discord**: Go into the [#course-chat](https://discord.com/channels/997940575590416435/1074124524632674335) channel.
- **Find other submissions**: Use the assignment hashtag name to find other submissions. While in the channel, you can use CMD/CTRL + F to bring up the finder in Discord. Type in the hashtag to find other submissions. Find one and pull it up.
- **Two things they did well**: Read through their commits, from the starting one and look for 2 things you think they did well. Leave a comments to start a discussion.
- **Two things you found interesting or might do differently & why**: Look for 2 parts of their design you either found interesting and start a discussion or comment how you might have implemented things differently. 

### 4. Design it twice (do it again)

- The last thing you can do is something John Ousterhout recommends, that I highly agree with: _design it twice_. Do it again. You've likely learned things you'd do differently. Drill it again. Programming is very much a tactile & pattern-matching activity. You just need reference experiences.
  
## How to deal with snags

- If you get stuck or run into any issues, use the [#course-chat](https://discord.com/channels/997940575590416435/1074124524632674335) channel in Discord to discuss so we can refine things and make 'em smoother.
